Intro
For this, I will create an image of a Minecraft villager using PyGame. The trickiest thing will be figuring out where to put everything. 


Reflection
The best way to show my locations and double-check that everything is centered is to create 2 lines that run down the middle of the screen, one along the x-axis and the other along the Y-axis. The best way to figure out placements is by looking at the other shapes and adding and subtracting their positions. This means once I have placed the body, everything else can just be created around that.
Plan
Make and set up the screen so that it shows
Set the background to white
Start with the body
Create the head
Make the Nose
Create both eyes and the eyebrow
Make the mouth
Finish with the arms
